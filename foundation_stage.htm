          most recent Ofsted Inspection Report in July 2009:<br>
          <em><font color="#000000">&quot;From their earliest days in school, 
          children are supported in making informed decisions and choosing resources 
          to work with. Adults are always there to help but give children frequent 
          opportunities to decide the direction of their learning. As a result, 
          children learn to be confident and independent learners. They are able 
          to take risks without being unnecessarily fearful and just love playing 
          and learning together in this warm, secure and happy environment.&quot;

        In 2011 Ofsted visited our school as part of their survey into good practice in schools with strong track records of high achievement in mathematics.<br>
        <em style="color: #000; text-align: left;">&lsquo;<span style="text-align: center">This  survey was conducted following a ministerial request for Ofsted to provide evidence  on effective practice in the teaching of early arithmetic. All of the schools visited  are successful institutions, as reflected in their most recent inspection  reports.While  many other highly effective schools might have been visited, the 20 schools selected  for the survey span a wide range of contextual characteristics, such as size and  location, as well as being educationally diverse due to their maintained or independent  status and varying attainment on entry to the school. Results of national Key  Stage 2 mathematics tests (taken at age 11, Year 6) for the maintained schools,  show their pupils&rsquo; progress has been significantly above the national average,  and often outstanding, for at least the last four consecutive years.&rsquo; </span></em></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#000066"><br>
 Our Nursery was featured in the report published in November 2011.

          Sale and Altrincham Advertiser's 'Great Schools Giveaway' competition 
          and decided to purchase a 'Trim Trail' for the Foundation Stage outdoor 
          environment. The newly installed trail is proving to be huge success 
          and is used daily by the Nursery and Reception children. As a treat 
          our Year 1 children are invited into the Foundation stage garden and 
          delight in the opportunity to use this wonderful new resource. The Trim 
          Trail challenges the children to develop their sense of balance, upper 
          body strength and their willingness to undertake a new activity with 
          confidence. </font></div>
