Money raised from a Friends of St Margaret Ward Bingo evening was used to buy the seeds, compost and tools needed to fill all our vegetable boxes this year. Just before Easter, children from Class 4 helped to plant potatoes, onions, tomatoes, strawberries and some flowers. Class 1 and Class 3 joined together to plant the rest of the seeds including lettuce, sprouts, beetroot and radishes. <br>
The four boxes are now bursting with beautiful home grown
      vegetables which are being looked after and cared for by the children.</font></font></div></td>
