          life.We met students and teachers, had our pictures taken and all received 
          a free pencil case.<br>
          We all enjoyed our day and now most children in Year 6 want to go to 
          university as part of their long term goal!</font></div></td>

        where our </font>Year 5 children take part in workshops to discover their

        university options. <br>
        The whole project has been a huge success, giving the children opportunities 
        to explore life at university and in the world of work as well as being 
        made aware of their own areas of intelligence.<br>
        The programme started in 2003 when the Centre for Urban Education developed 
        a primary project aimed at raising the aspirations of children in Greater

            the University of Manchester Careers Service once again invited our 
            Year 6 children to spend a day at the university.<br>
            The purpose of the visit was to help the children understand a little 
            more about university life and hopefully inspire in them a desire 
            to gain a degree, which often leads to a wider range of career options.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
            The children were introduced to the work of forensic scientists during 
            a fascinating workshop and had to examine the evidence available to 
            discover the 'murderer'! They had a great day and certainly came away 
            knowing much more about the range of courses and university options 
            available.<br>
            These are just some extracts from their thank you letters:<br>
            &quot;<em>I am writing to thank you for the brilliant day..our student 
            ambassador was very kind and patient with our group and we were lucky 
            to have her.&quot;<br>
            &quot;It has inspired me to study at Manchester University when I 
            am older.The university was bigger than I thought and has beautiful 
            buildings too.I loved the CSI because it was fun pretending to solve 
            a crime and finding out about DNA and that we have some the same as 
            a banana!&quot;<br>
            &quot;I really enjoyed the trip and some of the things I found out, 
            my parents didn't even know.I do wish I can go to this university 
            when I'm older so I can get a degree and graduate. I found the CSI 
            really fun to do as it was very convincing and interesting.&quot;<br>
            &quot;We learned a lot from the campus tour because we learned what 
            a student does at Manchester University.We went to the food court 
            and I had pizza like most people and it was very filling.The best 
            part was the workshop and it was a lot of fun finding out who was 
            the killer.&quot;</em></font></p>
